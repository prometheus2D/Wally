# Tester Documentation

Place documentation files here that are specific to the **Tester** actor.

These files (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.adoc`) are automatically loaded and injected
into the Tester actor's prompt as private reference context.

Other actors will **not** see these documents.

## Examples

- `test-plan.md` — test scenarios and edge cases
- `known-issues.md` — documented bugs and workarounds
- `acceptance-criteria.md` — detailed pass/fail criteria
