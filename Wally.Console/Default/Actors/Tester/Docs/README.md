# Tester Documentation

Place documentation files here that are specific to the **Tester** actor.

These files (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.adoc`) are inside the WorkSource tree, so
`gh copilot` can read them natively via `--add-dir`. Nothing is injected into
prompts.

To direct Copilot to a specific file, reference it by path in your prompt:

> Refer to `.wally/Actors/Tester/Docs/test-plan.md`

Useful files to add here:

- `test-plan.md` — test scenarios and edge cases
- `known-issues.md` — documented bugs and workarounds
- `acceptance-criteria.md` — detailed pass/fail criteria
