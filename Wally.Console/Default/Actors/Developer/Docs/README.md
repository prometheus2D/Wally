# Developer Documentation

Place documentation files here that are specific to the **Developer** actor.

These files (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.adoc`) are automatically loaded and injected
into the Developer actor's prompt as private reference context.

Other actors will **not** see these documents.

## Examples

- `architecture.md` — system architecture overview
- `coding-standards.md` — project coding conventions
- `api-reference.md` — API contracts and schemas
