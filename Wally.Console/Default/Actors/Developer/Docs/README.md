# Developer Documentation

Place documentation files here that are specific to the **Developer** actor.

These files (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.adoc`) are inside the WorkSource tree, so
`gh copilot` can read them natively via `--add-dir`. Nothing is injected into
prompts.

To direct Copilot to a specific file, reference it by path in your prompt:

> Refer to `.wally/Actors/Developer/Docs/architecture.md`

Useful files to add here:

- `architecture.md` — system architecture overview
- `coding-standards.md` — project coding conventions
- `api-reference.md` — API contracts and schemas
